# Weather Forecast

This application is a solution for forecasting the weather of cities around the planet. The application interacts with the google api to find search results by name of cities and after choosing a city it uses the latitude and longitude data to request the current and future weather forecast of the city in question from the open weather api . For its development I used typescript, react native, styled components, react hook technologies, among others. You can see the current status of the application on You Tube<br/>
